<h2 id="my-work">My work</h2>
<p>I joined this project in the end of the development. I was mainly a generalist trying to help with the simpler tasks, fixing minor bugs and trying to modify the visual layout of the app to better reflect the concept images.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>This is the first mobile app I’ve developed, and it has been a great experience.  The mentor I had was great and had patience with my sometimes-stupid questions which was really appreciated and helpful.</p>
