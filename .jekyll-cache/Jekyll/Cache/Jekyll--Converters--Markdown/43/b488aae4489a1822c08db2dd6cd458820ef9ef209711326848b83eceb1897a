<h2 id="the-parsing-system">The Parsing System</h2>
<p>My main focus during this project was to create the system that translates text into commands the designers can use. We used an external “speech to text”-plugin called Sphinx. The output from Sphinx were the input used in the parsing system. The system tries to find out if the words are a “Name”, “Action” or “Object”.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the name is in the beginning of the sentence the unit corresponding to that name is selected (registered as a listener to the command system).</li>
  <li>The next thing it looks for is an action like “pick up”, “eat” or “hug”.</li>
  <li>The last part of the command is what to do the Action to so it tries to identify an Object.</li>
</ul>

<p>When the system have recognized the whole command it is sent out to the listener. The listener have different events that the desginers of the game could use to create the desired action in game.</p>

<p>These are examples of some phrases that worked in the game;</p>

<h2 id="components">Components</h2>
<p>I’m also a big supporter of a component based system and were a big part of planning the architecture of the game. The reason we picked this architecture is to give the designers the freedom to create the game they wanted.</p>

<p>Me and my programmer teammates worked close with the designers to provide the functionality the designers needed to create the player experience they had envisioned. This worked very well and made it possible to iterate on the game in an effective manner.</p>

<p>Other than that I have been a part of many different systems, either by planning, helping or writing code together with other members of the team.</p>

<!-- ## Gameplay -->

<!-- <table>
<tr>
<td>
<h3> Voice Input: </h3>
The game uses voice input to control the game. By saying the characters name the player are able to select that character. After that the character listens for certain command such as "Go to camp" or "Pick up axe".
</td>
</tr>

</table>
<table>

<tr>
<td>
<h3> Survival: </h3>
<p>
The players goal is to help the characters survive on the island by guideing them. By telling them what to do the characters can collect, feed and move to locations that will help them survive. Part of the challenge is getting them to listen, they are teenagears after all.

<tr>
<td>
<h3> Ownership: </h3>
<p>
We want to give the player the ability to make the game their own adventure. By letting the player build up their own camp the player will be able to create their own story.
</p>
</td>
</tr>

</table>
<table>

<tr>
<td>
<h3> Management: </h3>
<p>
The game features three values that each character need to keep at a desired level. Each character has Hunger, Temperature and Comfort. Hunger slowly decreses and the character needs to eat to refill this value. Temperature is the temperature of the character which is affected by the weather, water and nearby heatsources. The final value is Comfort which controls the feelings of the character.

<h3> A Living Game: </h3>
<p>
We want the people to feel more alive. By adding the ability for them to have feelings towords different beings on the island. This makes them interact with each other in different ways.

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>The greatest hurdle during this project was to find the fun. The lesser used input method did in the end damage the game play by making it harder to control and less responsive. In the end we accepted this as a failed game, but we also recognized that this was still a fun experiment. Even though the game weren’t as fun as we hoped, some players found the game enjoyable in other ways. By just trying commands and see what happens did sometimes have a comical effect.</p>

<p>If I was to create another similar game I would focus more on developing the idea and figuring out beforehand how the input enhances the game play, and not just include it and see it become a gimmick.</p>

<!-- One of the most difficult challenges of this project was the relatively unique way of controlling the game. We picked voice input because of the player engagement. We wanted the player to feel kind of like a nagging parent and get to know the people they were controlling. Of course speech recognition is at its best not fully accurate, especially with different accents, which made this a somewhat difficult way of controlling the game. The game were planned and build around this feature which made it hard in the end to switch to another input, which in turn could have enhanced the game play.

Another challenge was the way we wanted the game to be experienced vs the way people interacted with the game. We wanted the player to try and communicate with the people by using different phrases which the player would find on its own. But with the feedback we got it was obvious that this was not a very fun way to experience this game. By adding a more extensive tutorial we believe we got a good balance between knowing the basic command while still throwing in some other "secret" phrases and keywords. -->
