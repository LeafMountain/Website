## The Idea
“A Dating Game where you get the chance to meet your mystery date with different fun and exciting games.
You simply activate your account by answering our “Quick Fire” questions and thru compatibility we will match you and your destiny partner.
Using distance activated face to face video calls, you will have 60 seconds to pick up.

What happens next is up to you!”

## My work
I joined this project in the end of the development. I was mainly a generalist trying to help with the simpler tasks, fixing minor bugs and trying to modify the visual layout of the app to better reflect the concept images.

## Final Thoughts

This is the first mobile app I’ve developed, and it has been a great experience.  The mentor I had was great and had patience with my sometimes-stupid questions which was really appreciated and helpful.
