## My Experience
I joined this project in the end of the development and, since we were a small team most of us worked on several parts of the application. I would describe my role as "generalist" since I worked with
* Fixing various bugs related to thing such as visual inconsistencies or faulty values from the backend server.
* Improving visuals to stisfy the customer while also keeping the flow of the experience.
* Generally polishing the application for release.

This is my first experience develeoping for a mobile device. It has been a great project with extremely nice and helpful people.
