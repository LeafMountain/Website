## Description

Momentum is set in a place where the technology is run on the forces of time. In order to sustain it, time has been harvested from several timelines. Due to this harvest, the time continuum has started to fall apart. It is up to you to find the locks which are keeping the time vault closed and release time back into the world before it is too late.

The objective was to create a rhythm based game play which challenges the playerâ€™s abilities on timing and planning. The player is equipped with a time manipulation device which can alter the states of certain platforms, structures and mechanisms. The player need to progress the level while overcoming the device's limitation of control.

## Player Movement

Responsive.
Follow terrain.
Speed run friendly ("bug")

## Time Manipulation tool

Iteration.
Showing rather than guessing.
Work closely with design.

## Level Design Tools
Showing paths to remove the guesswork

## Loose Design
Worked in the dark.
Tried to define it later.

## Final Thoughts
Define gameplay to test, create, iterate.
