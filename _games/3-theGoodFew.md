The Good Few is a colorful turn-based role-playing game sprinkled with city-building elements and resource management.

The game revolves around the story of a band of mercenaries who get drawn into an unending conflict between a trinity of nations, each with its own reasons for bloodshed and conquest.

Featuring a class and sub-class-based leveling system, an upgradeable player hub, customizable equipment, exciting character development, a variety of different environments to explore, and obviously lots of enemies and bosses to defeat.

My role in this project is:
* Main and only programmer
* Unity guide

This game was sent to Swedish Game Awards. It did not get nominated but we are proud see our game next to other great contributions.
