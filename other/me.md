## Who am I?

I am a passionate game nerd and game developer. I love dreaming of and creating experiences for me and other people and that is the reason I got in to game development. I have played games my whole life and now I want to contribute to the medium I spend most of my time with!

When I was younger I started developing in HTML and made a few personal websites. That later blossomed into an even bigger thirst when it came to programming. The feeling of making something work the way I wanted it to and to see it visually on the computer screen is a huge drive for me. I consider myself a lazy person (doing the dishes might be one of the most soul killing activities there is) but I do love putting work into solutions that makes it easier for me.

I'm currently a student living in Sweden studying game programming.
